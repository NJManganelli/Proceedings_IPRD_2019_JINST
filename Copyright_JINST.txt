If you have any questions or concerns, please email copyright@iop.org quoting the Article reference number.

*IMPORTANT INFORMATION – YOU WILL BE AGREEING TO TRANSFER YOUR COPYRIGHT IN THE ARTICLE*

Please take the time to review the agreement before submitting. The wording in the agreement below sets out the terms and conditions under which the Named Authors and/or Copyright Owners (as applicable) will transfer or license the copyright in the Article to SISSA and/or IOP. By submitting the agreement, you will be assumed to have read, understood and accepted all the terms and conditions.

Which parts of the agreement should you sign?

Please read the agreement carefully and then tick the appropriate box from section A, from section B and from section C in Part 3 to confirm:

    the basis upon which you would like the Article published if it is accepted (section A):

    Subscription (the terms set out in Part 1 will apply) – this means that the Article will be available to individuals and institutions who subscribe to the journal in which the Article is published.  This option generally meets the criteria of funding organisations to publish 'green open access' ('green open access' means that the Accepted Manuscript can be deposited in a non-commercial repository after a set period known as an embargo period).  Please see our Author Rights policy for further information on author rights after publication and ensure you are comfortable that it fulfils your requirements

Or

    Gold Open Access (the terms set out in Part 2 will apply) – this means the Article will be published under a CC BY licence and will be available to everyone immediately on publication with no embargo period.  For articles submitted to the Journal up to and including 31 May 2018, you will be required to pay the Article Publication Charge of £1400/$2220/€1600 (excluding VAT where applicable) for publication on a Gold Open Access basis. For articles submitted to the Journal from 1 June 2018, you will be required to pay the Article Publication Charge of £1700/$2700/€1950 (excluding VAT where applicable) for publication on a Gold Open Access basis. By signing the agreement, and selecting Gold Open Access, you will be responsible for ensuring that the applicable Article Publication Charge is paid in full, unless otherwise agreed in writing with IOP.
     

and

    the following (section B):

    For Subscription - to confirm that, where relevant, each Named Author who is affiliated to a university/institution has:
        checked whether their institution or university's open access policy is incompatible with IOP Publishing's green open access policy (some examples of incompatibility are set out further below), and
        if it is incompatible, has obtained a waiver for the Article from their university/institution (institutions/universities allow for such waivers in their policies).

Or

    For Gold Open Access - to confirm that you are responsible for ensuring that the applicable Article Publication Charge charged by the Journal for Gold Open Access is paid in full, unless otherwise agreed in writing.  


and

    the basis upon which you are granting SISSA and IOP the right to publish the copyright in the Article (section C):

    in most cases a standard transfer of copyright will apply (please select this box unless one of the other scenarios below applies), or

    under Crown copyright - the Article is fully protected by Crown copyright under section 163 of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 or any subsequent amendment to that Act, or

    under the laws relating to the US Government, or

    Other – this should only be selected if you cannot agree to the terms of the agreement.  Please note that, by selecting this, we will still require you to either re-sign the agreement or another agreement before we can accept the Article.


The Submitting Author should also sign and date the bottom of the agreement.

Who should sign the agreement if the Named Author(s) do not own the copyright in the Article?

If you, as the Named Author(s), do not own the copyright in the Article because, for example, it was prepared as part of your duties as employee(s), please

    warrant you have all the rights necessary to enter into the agreement on behalf of the Copyright Owner by filling in the full name of the organisation/company who owns the copyright in the Copyright Owner box below and entering your name and the date at the bottom of the agreement.

(Please ensure that you have made the Copyright Owner aware of the terms of the agreement and that you have the authority of the Copyright Owner to enter into the agreement on their behalf).       


Who should sign the agreement if the Article has more than one Named Author?

If there are several Named Authors, one author (the Submitting Author) should submit the agreement on behalf of their co-authors in a representative capacity.

The Submitting Author must ensure that they have the authority of all Named Authors to enter into the agreement on their behalf.

I am affiliated to a university/institution, do I need a waiver from my institution or university's open access policy?

All Named Authors who are affiliated to a university/institution, who are publishing an Article on a subscription basis (i.e. not on a gold open access basis), must each obtain a waiver for the Article from their institution or university's open access policy if it is incompatible with IOP Publishing's green open access policy.   Institutions/universities allow for such waivers in their policies.  Each Named Author affiliated to a university/institution is responsible for checking whether their university or institution's open access policy is incompatible with IOP Publishing's green open access policy.

What are examples of open access policies which are incompatible with IOP Publishing's green open access policy?

Examples are:

    if the policy requires immediate depositing of the Accepted Manuscript with the institution/university; or
    if the policy requires the Accepted Manuscript to be made generally available within a shorter embargo period than 12 months from the date of first online publication of the Final Published Version by IOP Publishing; or
    if the policy requires the Final Published Version (rather than the Accepted Manuscript) to be deposited; or
    if the policy requires an open access or any form of creative commons licence to be attached to the Accepted Manuscript when depositing it in the institution/university repository which does not comply with the copyright status of the Accepted Manuscript*; or
    if the institution/university repository automatically attaches an open access or creative commons licence to the Accepted Manuscript which does not comply with the copyright status of the Accepted Manuscript*.


The above list is intended to provide examples only and is not a comprehensive list of how a policy could be incompatible with IOP Publishing's green open access policy.

*Accepted Manuscripts of Journal of Instrumentation are fully protected by copyright, unless expressly stated otherwise by IOP.
