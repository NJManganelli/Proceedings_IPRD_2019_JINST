\title{Upgrade to the CMS Cathode Strip Chambers for the HL-LHC}


\abstract{The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) will be upgraded in several phases to significantly expand its physics program, and these upgrades present major challenges to the operations of the CMS Cathode Strip Chamber muon system. After the current long shutdown from 2018-2021 (LS2), the accelerator luminosity will be increased, exceeding the design value of $10^{34}cm^{-2}s^{-1}$ and allowing the CMS experiment to collect approximately 100 fb$^{-1}$/year. A subsequent upgrade in 2023-24 will increase the luminosity up to 5 x $10^{34}$cm$^{−2}$s$^{-1}$. The CMS muon system must be able to sustain a physics program after the LS2 shutdown that maintains sensitivity to electroweak scale physics and for TeV scale searches similar to what was achieved up to now. For the Cathode Strip Chamber (CSC) muon  detectors, the electronics will be upgraded to handle the expected higher data rates.  The design of the upgraded CSC electronics will be discussed.  In addition, accelerated irradiation tests are being performed to study the behaviour of the CSC electronics under conditions which are nearly an order of magnitude beyond the original design values. Studies have also been performed of chamber gas mixtures to reduce greenhouse-gas impacts. The status of this irradiation campaign and results will be presented.}

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
\paragraph{CSC}
The Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment \cite{detector}, located at Point 5 of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), will contain 4 muon detector sub-systems after Long Shutdown 2 (LS2) ends, each using different variants of gaseous detection technology.
In the forward region close to the beampipe, the Cathode Strip Chambers (CSCs) employ a multiwire proportional chamber (MWPC) design, providing both tracking and triggering information in the absolute pseudorapidities 0.9 -- 2.4.
540 chambers comprise the subsystem, partitioned into 2 endcaps with 4 disks per endcap and 2 to 3 rings per disk; each chamber is composed of 6 gas gaps with gold-plated tungsten wires sandwiched between two copper plates.
One copper plate is segmented into radial strips relative to the beampipe, and the wires are approximately perpendicular to the strips in order to facilitate measurements of the phi and radial coordinates of ionizing particles. The wires' angle from true perpendicular varies based on the magnetic field conditions where that chamber type is installed (this accounts for differing charge drift). The working gas is 40\% argon, 50\% CO$_{2}$, and 10\% CF$_{4}$, where muons ionize the argon and the 2.9kV -- 3.6kV potential induces e$^-$ and ion drift; e$^-$ avalanches form near the wires and corresponding images charges form on the cathodes (see figure \ref{fig:csc}). The sub-system contains 266,112 cathode strips and 210,816 wire-groups total that are read out by the front-end and back-end systems.

\end{figure}

\paragraph{Motivation for MWPC design}
The CSC design was chosen for the regions near the beampipe due to the following factors. First, it was necessary to use a technology supporting high rate capability, very high efficiency, and with good performance over a range of background occupancies (up to 104 Hz/cm$^2$) and magnetic field conditions.
Additionally, the system needed good position resolution, acceptable time resolution, and the ability to provide tracking and triggering as part of a highly-redundant, high-longevity system.

\paragraph{On-chamber electronics}
The principal electronics installed on each chamber are the Anode Front End Boards (AFEBs), Anode Local Charged Track (ALCT) mezzanine and baseboard, 
the Cathode Front End Boards (CFEBs), plus the Low Voltage Distribution Board (LVDB) and Motherboard (LVMB). The LVMB provides control and monitoring over power distribution, which is accomplished via the LVDB. The AFEBs are relatively simple readout devices connected to 16 wire groups each, 8 per layer; AFEBs connect to the ALCT baseboard, while the mezzanine houses the Fully Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) for determining the presence of ionization tracks in the wire-groups. The CFEBs are of greater complexity than AFEBs, with 96 strips from all 6 layers connected to each of the 4 -- 7 boards; they contain amplifiers connected to strip readout, which feeds into flash ADCs for buffering of data and digital comparators to quickly identify potential ionization tracks in the strips.

\caption{\label{fig:electronics} Layout of the on-chamber and off-chamber electronics. During LS2 the ALCTs, (D)CFEBs, and (O)TMBs are upgraded. During or before LS3, the (O)DMBs and FED system are upgraded. This figure is particular to non-ME1/1 chambers, with the principle differences being that ME1/1s have 7 Digital CFEBs and optical variants of the TMB and DMB. \cite{tdr}}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Off-chamber electronics}
For each set of 9 chambers, there is one VME crate containing off-chamber electronics, located approximately a dozen meters from the furthest chambers and on the periphery of the CMS detector.
The Trigger Mother Board (TMB) receives triggering information from the ALCT and the DCFEBs, then combines them into a potential local charged track (LCT). If a coincidence in potential tracks are found between the anode wire-groups and cathode strips, the information is sent to higher level trigger systems for determining whether the CMS detector should do a complete event readout. In the case that such a signal is received back from the central triggering system (a so-called Level-1 Accept, or L1A), the
Data-Acquisition Mother Board (DMB) takes the more detailed data from CFEBs and ALCT (which have longer delays in the case of the former) and transmits them to the Front End Driver. For each chamber there exists a TMB/DMB pair. Per crate, there is also a 
VME Crate Controller (VCC) for control, monitoring, and firmware loading; a Clock and Control Board (CCB), which synchronizes the (sub-)system to LHC collisions; the Muon Port Card (MPC) is the path by which trigger info is sent to the more central systems (the next stage being the Endcap Muon Track-Finder). See figure \ref{fig:electronics}.

%\paragraph{Front End Driver electronics -- FED}
The Front-End Driver (FED), located in a service cavern near the CMS detector, contains Detector-Dependent Units (DDUs) which collect data from DMBs and send them to an event builder computer farm. Each DDU collates input from 16 chambers from several disks using a staggered allocation, such that a muon passing through multiple in-line chambers has its information split amongst multiple DDUs.

\paragraph{Run II Performance}
The CSC subsystem maintained excellent stability and performance after nearly 200fb$^{-1}$ integrated luminosity (instantaneous luminosity up to 2x10$^{34}$Hz/cm$^2$). As seen in figure \ref{fig:runIIresolution}, the spatial resolution does not degrade between the 2017 and 2018 periods of Run II, and figure \ref{fig:runIIefficiency} shows the high efficiency of track reconstruction and trigger primitive creation for the 4 disks.

\end{figure}

\paragraph{Upgrade Motivation}
The principal goal of the High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider project is to increase data collection by an order of magnitude (to 3000+ fb$^{-1}$), which necessitates a five-fold increase to the instantaneous luminosity (up to 7.5x10$^{34}$Hz/cm$^2$) and thus more high-energy collisions and irradiation of sub-detectors.
%Higher average and peak number of proton-proton collisions per crossing-event (“pileup”)
The CMS collaboration will introduce the  Tracker sub-system to the Level 1 Trigger, and this requires increasing latency to 12.5$\mu$s, an increase of 3.5 over the Run II configuration. Besides the increased latency, the readout rate to the event builder server farm will also increase by 7.5 to 750kHz. All of these factors mean that the CSC sub-system must maintain chamber performance in harsher conditions than the chambers were designed for, and improve readout capability to match the longer latency and higher rates.

\section{Ensuring chamber longevity at the HL-LHC}
\label{sec:longevity}
\paragraph{Gamma Irradiation Facility (GIF++)}Given the particle rate and radiation increase for the HL-LHC, the CSC sub-system embarked on a campaign to test chamber performance and longevity to ensure good performance for the lifetime of the new physics program. CERN has commissioned the upgraded Gamma Irradiation Facility++ in order to test sub-detectors and their electronics in as realistic an environment as possible. This location combines a muon beam up to 100 -- 150 GeV/c with a $^{137}$Cs gamma source. GIF++ permits accelerated aging (up to 30x) and testing,
and can reasonably model a worst-case HL-LHC neutron-induced background where the CSCs are installed.
\paragraph{Projected HL-LHC performance and longevity}
Aging effects may manifest as changes in gas gain or the formation of dark currents. Si and C polymerization on wires can ruin uniformity and drop the gas gain, and this is the worst form of aging for a wire chamber; additionally, continuous discharges may form (collectively dark currents), such as in the Malter Effect. See reference \cite{aging} for more details. Because of the focus on the anode, one way of characterizing wire chamber irradiation is via accumulated charge per unit length (of wire). After an exposure 3 times higher than expected for the HL-LHC program, no development of strong dark currents are detected, and most importantly, there is negligible change to the spatial resolution, as seen in figure \ref{fig:PerformanceHLLHC} \cite{highlights}. Within the limitations of accelerated aging tests, the results indicate the CSC sub-system can serve its function throughout the desired lifetime of the experiment.

No dark current formation is found up through thrice the HL-LHC lifetime. \cite{aging}}
\end{figure}

\section{Reducing greenhouse gas consumption}
\label{sec:ghg}
\paragraph{Minimizing CF$_4$ content}
The nominal gas mixture performed well for chamber longevity in Run II. However, CF$_4$ has 6500x the global warming potential (GWP) of CO$_2$ (on a 100 year horizon), and acquisition is expected to become constrained. Studies undertaken with reduced CF4 content show negligible aging and degradation through 3x HL-LHC accumulated charge as measured by gas gain losses and dark current formation. However, when the content is reduced to 2\%, there is visible surface darkening on the anodes, indicating surface pollution (see figure \ref{fig:PerformanceCF4Reduced}). As such, 5\% CF$_4$ is the lowest acceptable content, and a reduction to this level is not yet anticipated.

No indication of aging is detected in this measurement. \cite{reduction} (bottom) Surface pollution with reduced CF$_4$, especially when dropped to 2\%, making such a reduction inadvisable. \cite{reduction}}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Exploring CF$_4$ replacements}
Preliminary studies with one substitute for CF$_4$ that has a GWP less than 1, HFO-1234ze (HFO), show potential. 
The results visible in figure \ref{fig:PerformanceHFO} are the first in a CSC-type detector, HFO having been previously studied for Resistive Plate Chambers. 
An open gas loop in a 30cm square prototype constructed with standard CSC materials was used.
Similar gas gain and drift velocities as 10\% CF4 are attainable with a 100V High-voltage working point shift \cite{aging}. Measurements up through a safety factor of 10 were made, showing no significant degradation until more than 800mC/cm (8x HL-LHC accumulated charge).
Further tests at GIF++ are scheduled with a full size chamber attached to a closed gas loop, where a slower acceleration factor will be used.

No dark current formation is found until approximately 7 times HL-LHC lifetime. Wires 3, 4 refer to the ones closest to the local irradiation source in the prototype used for these tests. \cite{hfo}}
\end{figure}

\section{Electronics upgrades for the HL-LHC}
\label{sec:electronics}
\paragraph{Data losses at HL-LHC}
Due to the aforementioned increases to trigger and particle rates, drastic memory overflows and large readout inefficiencies/event losses are expected. In other words, the system needs to store more event data for a longer duration, then have access to more bandwidth to send them off-chamber. Figure \ref{fig:EventLoss} contains projections for the rings that will suffer the most, the ME2/1, ME3/1, and ME4/1 chambers. The ME1/1 chambers escape these losses as they received upgrades during Long Shutdown 1. The remaining CSCs closest to the beamline require upgraded on-, off-chamber electronics, and most must be installed in LS2 due to the schedule constraints of Long Shutdown 3 (just prior to the start of HL-LHC collisions).

\caption{\label{fig:EventLoss} (left) The event losses for ME2/1, ME3/1, and ME4/1 chambers with CFEBs installed become drastic at the proposed HL-LHC luminosity. However, replacing CFEBs with upgraded Digital CFEBs as seen on the rightmost curve entirely mitigate the issue. \cite{tdr} (right) The interaction point is to the lower left, with the beamline along the z-axis. As can be seen, the ME1/1 is the least shielded from non-muons, while ME4/1 is the most shielded amongst the innermost rings. \cite{performance} }
\end{figure}

\paragraph{(x)DCFEB}
The Digital Cathode Front End Board (DCFEB) is an upgraded CFEB with a Virtex-6 FPGA, flash ADCs, digital pipeline (approximately 700 events deep), and 3.2Gbps optical transmitters. These were designed and installed as an upgrade for ME1/1 chambers during LS1; now they are being replaced and passed down to ME2/1, ME3/1, ME4/1 chambers. As replacement for the DCFEBs being removed from ME1/1s, the xDCFEB (DCFEBv2) has been produced with CERN's radiation-hard Versatile Twin Transmitter (VTTx) and bidirectional Versatile Transceiver (VTRx) installed. A new capability to remotely program the FPGA via optical link and Gigabit Transceiver (GBTx) is included, providing a backup option in the event of EEPROM death due to the high radiation environment. Due to problems with the original optical transmitters on DCFEBs, they are retrofitted with VTTXs during the upgrade process, and 9 ME2/1 chambers received xDCFEBs instead of DCFEBs due to too few of the latter (accounting for spares) existing from the LS1 production.
\paragraph{ALCT}
Similar upgrades are necessary for the anode readout, in the form of new mezzanines.  Spartan-6 FPGAs are employed, with 9x -- 12x Block RAM of the original Virtex-E FPGAs. Optical transmitters provide 8x -- 12x the bandwidth of copper interconnects for the forward-most rings (ME1/1, 2/1, 3/1, 4/1). For chambers that read out 288 -- 382 wire-groups, a smaller Spartan-6 is used; the ALCT-LX100 includes a VTRx when installed on ME1/1 chambers, supporting optical data readout to the new ODMB7 (4.48Gbps) and EEPROM-less programming as in xDCFEBs. For the larger chambers, an ALCT-LX150T is installed, having FPGA resources for 576 -- 672 wire-groups. A VTTx provides up to 6.4Gbps data transmission to new ODMB5s, but until the ODMB5s are furnished after LS2, the old copper interconnects will suffice.

\paragraph{OTMB}
(x)DCFEBs output their trigger information through optical transmitters, thus they require an Optical TMB. The OTMB designed and produced in 2013 for ME1/1 have been moved to peripheral crates for ME3/1 and ME4/1 CSCs. ME1/1 and ME2/1 crates will be outfitted with the new OTMB (2019) design in January 2020, almost identical to the 2013 version except for Samtec Firefly transceivers and the inclusion of inputs from the Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) sub-system. This input allows synergy between the two sub-systems once the GEMs are installed, as 
combining CSC and GEM trigger information increases efficiency and permits development of new triggering algorithms, such as for displaced muons. Additionally, in the forward-most regions the CSC chambers have been the only muon triggering system, and GEMs will provide redundancy for the HL-LHC program.

\paragraph{ODMB}
Chambers with (x)DCFEBs will receive new Optical DMBs by the time HL-LHC starts operation. During Run III, prior to the installation of these boards, non-ME1/1 chambers with new on-board electrons will use the backwards-compatible copper interconnects to DMBs. The new ODMBs will come in two variants, ODMB5 for ME2/1, ME3/1, ME4/1 chambers that have 5 (x)DCFEBs, and an ODMB7 for the ME1/1 chambers (7 xDCFEBs each). A Kintex Ultrascale FPGA is the core of the new boards, with Firefly optical transceivers rated at 3.2Gbps for the (x)DCFEBs and either a 4.8Gbps bidirectional link for the ME1/1 ALCT or a dual 3.2Gbps receiver for ALCT-LX150T mezzanines. To connect to the new FED, ODMB5s will use 2 -- 3 10+Gbps links, and ODMB7s 4 such links. As seen in figure \ref{fig:Bandwidth}, this results in some safety margin for the 4 innermost rings of chambers, and chambers in the ME4/2 ring will have the smallest margin between required and available bandwidth.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering % \begin{center}/\end{center} takes some additional vertical space
\includegraphics[width=.85\textwidth]{Bandwidth.png}
\caption{\label{fig:Bandwidth} The Phase-2 bandwidth will exceed the projected HL-LHC needs by a small margin, with the increase bandwidth of ODMB7s and ODMB5s apparent versus the Phase-1 bandwidth. 4 Links are available for ME1/1 ODMB7s, while ODMB5s are configured to use 2 or 3 links to the FED based on which ring they're installed for. The figure is produced with an expected PileUp of 200 pp collisions per bunch crossing (PU200). [from personal correspondence with Jaebak Kim, Oct. 2, 2019]}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{FED}
During LS3, the FED will receive an upgrade coinciding with new ODMBs. An industry standard, the Advanced Telecommunications Computing Architecture (ATCA), is common to many CMS upgrade projects. In particular, the CSCs will share the same processing module with parts of the new GEM muon sub-detector which is being installed in stages during LS2 (GE1/1), LS3 (ME0), and in-between (GE2/1). The shared module will consist of an APX Consortium card (APT) (figure \ref{fig:FED}) with 100 bidirectional links rated at 25Gbps and a Virtex Ultrascale FPGA (VU9P currently). The total CSC Data Acquisition rate will be 1344 Gbps, an aggregate of chambers using DMBs with 1.6Gbps links, chambers with ODMB5s using 2 -- 3 12.25Gbps links, and 72 ME1/1 chambers using 4 12.25Gbps links per ODMB7. At a minimum, 9 APT boards will make up the new FED system, replacing 36 DDUs. (Information from personal correspondence with Evaldas Juska, Oct. 8, 2019)

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
\paragraph{}
Cathode Strip Chambers are a classic technology that provided all of the necessary ingredients for a successful muon tracking and triggering system in the CMS forward region.
The CSC subsystem has thus far demonstrated great performance and longevity with nominal gas mixture and electronics.
To evaluate more eco-friendly options, studies are underway with reduced CF4 and substitutes like HFO-1234ze.
Higher latency and event rates at the HL-LHC necessitate upgrades of on- and off-chamber electronics, the core tenets being more bandwidth (optical instead of copper links) and deeper buffers. These upgrades are underway currently, having successfully reached the halfway point of the LS2 schedule and scope.
